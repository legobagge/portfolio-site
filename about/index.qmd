## Hi, I'm [Your Name] 👋

I'm a data scientist and engineer specializing in the intersection of AI, analytics engineering, and statistical modeling. I'm passionate about building production-grade machine learning systems and applying rigorous statistical methods to solve complex business problems.

### Background

<div class="card" style="margin: 2rem 0;">

My journey into data science began with a fascination for how probabilistic reasoning could quantify uncertainty in decision-making. Over the years, I've developed expertise across:

- **Machine Learning Engineering**: Designing and deploying scalable ML systems that serve millions of predictions
- **Bayesian Statistics**: Building probabilistic models for decision-making under uncertainty
- **Causal Inference**: Applying econometric methods to measure true causal effects
- **Data Architecture**: Creating robust data pipelines and transformation workflows
